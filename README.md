# spring-role-based-security

ðŸ”§ How It Works Behind the Scenes:
âœ… @PreAuthorize uses Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to evaluate security rules before entering the method.

âœ… hasRole('XYZ') internally looks for authorities named ROLE_XYZ.

âœ… Spring Security adds the "ROLE_" prefix automatically to roles declared using roles("ADMIN").

Summary:  
âœ… @Secured("ROLE_ADMIN") checks for a specific role at the method level.

âœ… Good for simple role-based access.

âœ… Use @PreAuthorize(...) when you need more advanced logic or expressions.
